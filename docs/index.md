Dragon TT
---------

DragonTT is a simple implementation of Tetris for [DragonRuby](https://www.dragonruby.org).

Initially intended as a simple testbed to check out the toolkit, it turned into a stable, playable
and even *releasable* game inside of a week.

So, that answers the question of how good DragonRuby is!


The source is available her on GitHub; you can find a playable HTML version [right here](game/index.html)
and executables for other platforms over on [itch.io](https://ahnlak.itch.io/dragontt)
